## Project information


- Use of various textures with different transformations throughout the whole scene.
- Implementation of different cameras:
    - Prepective cameras that allow to see closely diferent relevant objects (e.g: Robot, Carocha).
    - Orthographic cameras: Left, Right, Top, Front, Back.
- Additional section of the interface to make the axis visible or invisible.
- Additional section of the interface to control the texture of the floor.
- Additional section of the interface controls the diffuse and specular colors, as well as the shininess of the floor.
- Additional section of the interface is responsible for managing all the parameters of the spotlight positioned above the cake, such as: turn off, turn on, change its color.

In figure 3 it's possible to see:
* **Coffe Table:** On the coffee table there is a **three-layered cake** with a lit **candle** emitting a soft light, and a **stack of plates**.
* **Television** currently turned off.
* **Comfy Seating:** A sofa and an armchair adorned with differently sized pillows. On the armchair, there is also a newspaper.
* **Cabinets**: There are three cabinets: Two **bookshelves** filled with **books** on the front and right wall, and a **sturdy cabinet** placed on the floor, bellow the television. The colors of the **books** are random: they change every time the page is refreshed.
* **Artsy Vase**: A **vase made of cylinders** holding a bunch of paper flowers. The colors of the flowers are chosen randomly, so they change every time the page refreshes.
* **Robot**: There is also a robot seated on the sofa, holding a plate with a piece of **cake**.
