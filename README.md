#### Project Information

- Use of various textures with different transformations throughout the whole scene.
- Implementation of different cameras:
    - Prepective cameras that allow to see closely diferent relevant objects (e.g: Robot, Carocha)
    - Orthographic cameras: Left, Right, Top, Front, Back
- Additional section of the interface to control the texture of the floor.
- Additional section of the interface controls the diffuse and specular colors, as well as the shininess of the floor.
- Additional section of the interface is responsible for managing all the parameters of the spotlight positioned above the cake, such as: turn off, turn on, change its color.
