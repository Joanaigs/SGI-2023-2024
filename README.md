## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

#### Project Information

- Use of various textures with different transformations throughout the whole scene.
- Implementation of different cameras:
    - Prepective cameras that allow to see closely diferent relevant objects (e.g: Robot, Carocha).
    - Orthographic cameras: Left, Right, Top, Front, Back.
- Additional section of the interface to make the axis visible or invisible.
- Additional section of the interface to control the texture of the floor.
- Additional section of the interface controls the diffuse and specular colors, as well as the shininess of the floor.
- Additional section of the interface is responsible for managing all the parameters of the spotlight positioned above the cake, such as: turn off, turn on, change its color.


#### Scene 
Our scene represents the living room of a lonely robot on its birthday.

In figure 3 it's possible to see:
* **Coffe Table:** On the coffee table there is a **three-layered cake** with a lit **candle** emitting a soft light, and a **stack of plates**.
* **Television** currently turned off.
* **Comfy Seating:** A sofa and an armchair adorned with differently sized pillows. On the armchair, there is also a newspaper.
* **Cabinets**: There are three cabinets: Two **bookshelves** filled with **books** on the front and right wall, and a **sturdy cabinet** placed on the floor, bellow the television. The colors of the **books** are random: they change every time the page is refreshed.
* **Artsy Vase**: A **vase made of cylinders** holding a bunch of paper flowers. The colors of the flowers are chosen randomly, so they change every time the page refreshes.
* **Robot**: There is also a robot seated on the sofa, holding a plate with a piece of **cake**.

In figure 4 it's possible to see:
* **Dining table with chairs** where it is placed a **metal coil** and a **glass vase** holding a beautiful **sunflower**.
* **Picture frames** with Monet paintings on the wall.
* **Car neon sign** made of curves.
* **Large windows** featuring curtain rods and curtains made from curved surfaces.

### [TP2 - Development of a 3D graphics application](tp2)

#### Project information


In this project, a scene was generated by parsing an XML file and incorporating code to facilitate its interpretation. Various advanced textures were employed, including **skybox**, **mip-maps**, **bump textures**, **video textures**, and **specular maps**.
Objects were also created using both objects belonging to THREE.JS classes and **buffer geometry**. It's crucial to highlight in this scene the varying level of detail in materials based on distance, achieved through the **use of LODs** (Level of Detail).
Finally, it's worth noting the **creativity** of the scene and the imaginative manner in which objects were created. Additionally, the level of **control and interactivity** within the scene is noteworthy.


#### Strong Points
* **Creative** application of the discussed techniques to produce the scene. For example:
    * Use of both polygons and lods to create a paiting of a sunflower (made with polygons) that rotates when the distance to it changes (made with LoDs).
    * Use of nurb curves to make Christmas Socks and Candy Canes.
* **High level of control and interactivity** with the scene.
* **High detail** on the objects created.


#### Scene Information

##### Description
The created scene consists of an interior part, featuring a festively decorated living room for the Christmas season, and an exterior part that showcases the outside of the house where the living room is contained, surrounded by trees, fences, and a snowman nearby the entrance.


##### Techniques used:

##### 1. Construction of objects

| Objects | Techniques |
| -------- | -------- | 
| Candycanes on the Coffe Table, Socks hanging on the chinmey, Curtains, Cloth on the dinner table, Vase, Pillows  | Nurbs     | 
| Table, Chair, Chimney, Santa Claus' Legs, Cabinet, Bookshelf, Sofas, Lampshades, Plates, Food (cookies and cup of milk), candles, Paiting Frames, Walls, Roof, Floor, Doors | Three.JS Objects    | 
| Windows on the outside of the house, Paiting representing a sunflower, Carpet, Chritmas Tree Star in the second level of detail   | Buffer Geometry (Polygons)    | 

##### 2. Texture techniques employed

| Object | Texture Technique |
| -------- | -------- | 
| Outside Landscape   | SkyBox    | 
| Paitings on the Dinning Side of the living room  | Mip-Maps
| Material on the chinmey, Material on the outside foundation of the house, the wood material of trunks of the trees and the fences and the roof | Bump-Texture   | 
| Video on the television | Video Texture   | 
| House Roof | Specular-Map   | 


##### 3. LoDs

Many materials have different levels of detail.

* The christmas tree has 3 levels of detail:
    * The first level is composed by 3 cylinders with all the decorations and gifts at the bottom. 
    * The second is composed by 2 cylinders, whithout decorations except for the star at the top that turns into a polygon and the gifts at the bottom.
    * The thrid level is composed by only 1 cylinder with no decorations and no gifts at the bottom.
* The outside trees have 3 levels of detail: The first level is composed by 3 cylinders, the second is composed by 2 cylinders and the third level is composed by only 1 cylinder.
* The bookshelf has 2 levels of detail: One where it's possible to see all the selves and other where the shelves part is changed by a compact box.
* The vase has 2 levels of details: One where its possible to see its curves, and other where this curves turn into cylinders, giving the vase a more straight appearance.
* The snowman has also 3 levels:
    * One where it's possible to see the 3 balls that make its body, eyes, arms, buttons and hat.
    * Second one where it's only possible to see the 3 balls that make its body and the hat.
    * Third one where it's only possible to see the ball corresponding to the head of the snowman with the hat,and a oblate sphere corresponding to the rest of the body.
* The house outside is composed by different materials, but that combined give four levels of detail:
    * On the first level, the front of the house features a porch with a door and a handrail. Additionally, there are three windows: one on the roof, one on the left, and another on the right.
    * Moving to the second level, the porch undergoes a transformation, being replaced by a box. Simultaneously, the octagonal window on the roof is replaced by a circular one. At this level of detail, the window frames are not visible, allowing only the glass to be seen, and the berm of the chinmey also disappears.
    * On the third level of detail, all the windows and the chinmey disappear
* The fence outside has 2 levels of detail:
    * One where it's possible to see large trunks connected by smaller horizontal trunks.
    * Second one where it's only possible to see the larger trunks.


#### Interactions available

* Make the axis visible or not visible
* Turn On/Off each existent light.
* Change the camera, allowing to focus on different objects of the scene.
* Switch between Wireframe visualization or normal visualization.
* Change the magFilter and minFilter of the textures.
* Make the Santa Claus in the chinmey go Up or Down.
* Change the texture of the the socks hanging on the chimney.
* Change the light mode of the chritmas tree (On, Off and Blinking).
* Change the color of the tree decorations (It's possible to either choose the color manually or toggle a button to randomly assign a color to each ball).
* Alter the quantity of cookies displayed on the plate placed on the coffee table.
* Adjust the amount of milk in the cup placed on the coffee table.
* Turn ON/OFF the candles on the dinning table.
* Turn ON/OFF the video and sound on the television.
